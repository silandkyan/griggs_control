TODO:
    - find out scaling factor for s3 with printing ADC value while on known oil-P: 
        -> we use scaling on [MPa] consistently 
    - find out about opened and closed valve positions via valve_test_run.py
    - remember to adapt threshold values for oilp [Mpa?] and valve [steps?]
    - find suitable ranges for pre- and quench velocity 
    - rename position_quenched.csv 
    - for testrun if works: 
        - add test files in dirs of griggs pc: mocopa_Test (src), GUI_Test (modules), 
        main_window_Test (gui) and position_quenched (src)
        - uncomment: s1 definitions, data container functions, plot functions,...?!
    - how does save files work and why needed?
    - does stop motors make sense as safety measure so motor won't start spontaneously 
    driving when reestablishing connection after cutting connection with quit while driving?
    
NOTES: 
       
    - for relationship between: internal unit of current - Amps on hardware manual p.26-27 
                                max-Amp - (velocity) - torque on hardware manual p.31       
    - copied multimotor control for: stop_motors, permanent_down 
    permanent_up, multi_step_down, multi_step_up, rpm box changed, and rpm slider
    from gui simple 
    -> checkBoxes: motor s1 and motor s3 ONLY AFFECT THESE FUNCTIONS!!
    
    - if usb connection of s3 gets disconnected during permanent running, the steps done
    until power is killed, are made automatically at next program start!! 
    -> never kill usb connection at first
    
    - stop during multistep on 90 (default) has very very slow ramp!
    
    - test if position gets saved if app is closed right upper corner:
    -> no, program finishes anyways and then closes after command train got handled
    
    - if usb connection gets killed and reestablished: some error with actual_velocity for s3 
    appears
    
    - established crash protection for max range of motor
    
    - established stable position imports
